### 6. Limitationüëé
- Since it only plays the sentences containing the searched expression, the length of the video is very short, usually around 1 to 4 seconds. It doesn't show the sentences before or after, so __it's impossible for students to understand the context of the situation just from one video__. It's cumbersome to search again to find sentences that can be used before and after.
- _In other words, it's a useful site for studying pronunciation and intonation rather than understanding the context of the sentences._
