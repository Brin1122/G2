## A Digital tool for language teaching and learning : _'Yarn'_
### 1. Primary Function
- It allows users to search for specific words, phrases, or sentences and then __retrieves scenes from movies, dramas, or animations where those words or phrases are spoken__. The retrieved scenes are typically short, ranging from 1 to 4 seconds, and users may have the option to save or create GIFs from these scenes. This feature enhances the user experience by providing visual context for the searched content.
### 2. Purpose in English Learning
- Teachers can directly play out for students how new words are used in certain situations and in which sentences. Moreover, by showing scenes of how newly learned expressions are used in daily life through videos, __students can listen to and imitate the intonation of those moments__, thereby improving their intonation skills in real-life situations.
- _The important thing is that you can hear the pronunciation and intonation of entire sentences, not just individual words._
